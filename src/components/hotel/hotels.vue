          It’s not easy to offer immaculate service and be disarmingly down to
          earth at the same time, but staff at the 12 -room Ett Hem in
          Stockholm’s leafy embassy district manage the trick with aplomb. The
          name means “home” – in this case, a stylish temple to Nordic cosiness.
          Housed in a mansion built in 1910, the hotel’s design shows how it
          might have looked in its day, with candlelit, parquet-floored drawing
          rooms furnished with contemporary and vintage Scandinavian furniture –
          one with a grand piano for all to play – that lead into a book-lined
          dining room. There are plenty of places to curl up, dine or both. The
          food is exceptional: the chefs – several escapees from
          Michelin-starred restaurants – rustle up local, seasonal meals on
          request (beef tartare kimchi was a favourite) in front of guests at
          the kitchen table. There’s also a pretty conservatory, terraced garden
          and Swedish sauna. Each bedroom is decadent and unique, with an
          antique porcelain-tiled wood burner here, a vast free-standing tub
          there. Double rooms from £300.

          As Jean-Louis and Jocelyne Sibuet strolled in the mountains above
          stylish Megève, they were captivated by the rustic charm of the
          ancient timber chalets peppering the Alpine pastures. Several years
          later, in 1989, the duo launched their first Megève hotel, Les Fermes
          de Marie, made of materials from those very chalets, transported a
          short walk from the heart of Megève and painstakingly restored.
          Reminiscent of a rural hamlet, linked by meandering footpaths and
          burbling streams, the nine chalets contain 70 cosy rooms and suites,
          three restaurants, a ski shop and the original cowshed-chic spa. In
          the outdoor hot tub, guests soak ski-tired legs, contemplating the
          blanket of snow settled over wide timber eaves, the fragrant pine
          swags and neatly stacked logs cut for the countless open fires that
          warm the hotel’s restaurants, inviting snugs and free-standing
          chalets. The smallest of the chalets, Mont Blanc, is surely one of the
          world’s finest suites: picture-perfect, with its own garden, a homely
          sitting room with a vast open fire and a romantic double room. Double
          rooms from £298.

          A throwback to the F Scott Fitzgerald era, this grand 19th-century
          mansion on Cap d’Antibes has 117 rooms and two villas with sumptuous
          Louis XV and XVI furnishings, gilded mirrors and chandeliers. The
          gastronomic Eden-Roc Restaurant has just been renovated and serves
          classics such as roasted sea bass and lobster with tarragon; the Grill
          offers Provençal-style gambas at the seafront pavilion. Set among nine
          hectares of landscaped gardens, there are five clay tennis courts, a
          Sisley spa and a seawater pool cut into the natural rock. A seafront
          diving board and overwater trapeze launch bathers into the
          Mediterranean and there is a jetty for guests arriving by boat. Best
          of all are the 33 beach cabins where the illustrious and notorious
          come to hide: Marc Chagall used to paint on these clifftops, Roger
          Moore waterskied here and Johnny Weissmuller used to do his signature
          Tarzan yell as he dived into the sea. Double rooms from £400.
